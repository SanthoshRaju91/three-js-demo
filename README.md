##Three JS with HTML 5 device orientation API and socket.io 

This is demo application for creating a new stack for IOT, three.js, HTML5 device orientation API & socket.io, complete stack creation is in progress. In the meantime, checkout this repo and follow the instruction to view the new stack.

* Checkout the repo
  
  `git clone https://github.com/SanthoshRaju91/three-js-demo.git`
  
* Go to the directory & install the node modules

  `npm install`
  
* Start the app
  `node app.js`

Now open the application in device orientation supported browser, such as Chrome or Morzilla (no IE please, another reason why we Dev's should file a petition to stop using IE browsers ;) )

Next, open the app in mobile / tablet via network (coz of device can be rotated and the orientation can be computed). Once the app is opened in mobile / tablet rotate the device to see the magic in browser where you have opened the application. 

Please contribute to the project, share your thoughts so we can work together. Thank for being patient untill the final version of the stack is released.
